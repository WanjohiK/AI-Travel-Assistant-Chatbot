🧩 Example Use Case

### User:

Hello. I would like to travel from US to UK. I have two neurodivergent kids. Kindly recommend a good airline.

### Assistant:

For traveling with neurodivergent children, I recommend choosing an airline known for excellent customer service and support for families with special needs. Delta Airlines is a good choice as they often provide services to accommodate various requirements, including support for families traveling with children who have special needs. They offer assistance at the airport and in-flight to ensure a comfortable journey.
